# Cutest-mon

## Whys

I built this project to practice my learnings about tRPC and TypeScript. Encountering difficulties, bugs, and errors and overcoming them is the best teacher and provides a great confidence boost.

## About the project

Vote cuter pokemon and let's together decide the cutest pokemon of all

## Run in your local

At the current stage of this repo, you can clone it and run in your local without editing anything.

Run `yarn` then `yarn dev` these commands will run the app in your `localhost:3000`

## TODOS

- [ ] needs some refactoring
- [x] shouldn't expose `.env` file in the repo
